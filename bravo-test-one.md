### Git Process
- create a repo (folder/directory)
- clone the repo- (transfers the file from remote(github) to local (computer))
-Make a file - on terminal write "touch"
  -make sure you are inside the repo
  -naming conventions - lowercase, no spaces
  -Extension- what file type, what language (ex: .md for markdown)
-Added some content
-Added Personal Access Token authentication - saved to notes
-Local --> remote
  - git status
  - git add .
  - git commit -m "message" "goal of message:human communication of what is occurring"
  - git push origin main (not always main)

### Useful Git commands
```
git add .
git command -m "something that is helpful to future me"
git push origin main
```

### Useful Terminal commmands
```
ls- lists all the content of the current directory
touch- makes a new file
cd <name> - changes directory into another nested folder 
cd .. - moves back one level, moves
